# Discord-Clone

### Project Link(deployed) :  https://discord-clone-traptrick.web.app/

###### I wanted to practice and polish my react skills, so i tried to build this Discord Clone. This react app is made using REDUX for state management and Firebase for Authentication and Database.
---  
##### Getting Started
create a file in the root project directory named
`firebase-config.js`
using the following template:

```
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY_HERE,
    authDomain: YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN_HERE,
    projectId: YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID_HERE,
    storageBucket: YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET_HERE,
    messagingSenderId: YOUR_FIREBASE_SENDER_ID_HERE,
    appId: YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID_HERE,
    measurementId: YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID_HERE
};

export default firebaseConfig;
```
